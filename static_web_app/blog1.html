        This week’s additional book club pick is <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em>, and
        the excitement is magical. Members have already been spotted bringing
        wands, scarves, and butterbeer recipes to share during the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re a lifelong fan of the wizarding world or a newcomer, this is
        the perfect chance to relive the wonder of Hogwarts. We’ll be discussing
        our favorite characters, the meaning behind the Sorting Hat’s choices, and
        maybe even debating whether Snape was misunderstood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t forget to bring your favorite spell—metaphorically speaking—to liven
        up the discussion.
